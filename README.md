**JS driven note aplication** 

HTML / CSS / JS 

I created this note aplication with the CRUD methidology in mind

**Create:**

create note which passes an object to store the data

**Update**

Using the edit button will allow you to edit - title and description

**Read**

Data is read from both the current object holding note data and also the stored local data.
Local stored data is kept in JSON format and then converted back to a JS object for the app to
present to the user

**Delete**

Completing a note will remove it from the current active notes and move it into a completed obj,
Saving the note will remove the note from the local storage and create/update a completed_local note JSON file
