# Notables

This is a note apliaction built out using Pure JS - 

I intend to have several versions of this aplcation: 

Road Map: 

v1 - current build

Aplications, takes notes, stores them until they are completed or until the aplcation is reset

v2 - aplcation uses local storage of the device to keep a record of the notes taken for more functioncal use

v3 - additional reporting to be added, so, user may better understand there ability to fulfill tasks

v4 - log on system to be implimented so data can be accsessed from multiple platforms

v5 - practices will be implimented into the MEDS aplcation

----

This build will most likerly be rebuilt using a frame work and pointed at as reference.
